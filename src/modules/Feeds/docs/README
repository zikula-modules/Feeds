Feeds 2.6.0
===========

Feeds requires the System plugin SimplePie
Zikula 1.3.0 ships with the SimplePie plugin located in the 
docs/examples/plugins/ExampleSystemPlugin/SimplePie directory. It must be copied
(or symlinked) from there and pasted into /plugins

The plugin must then be installed. This is done via the Extensions module. Click
on the System Plugins menu item and install the SimplePie plugin.

Then you may install the Feeds modules as you normally would install any module.
